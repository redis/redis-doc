Renames `key` to `newkey`.
It returns an error when `key` does not exist.
If `newkey` already exists it is overwritten, when this happens `RENAME` executes an implicit `DEL` operation, so if the deleted key contains a very big value it may cause high latency even if `RENAME` itself is usually a constant-time operation.

In Cluster mode, both `key` and `newkey` must be in the same **hash slot**, meaning that in practice only keys that have the same hash tag can be reliably renamed in cluster.
