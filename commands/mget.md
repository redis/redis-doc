Returns the [Redis string](/docs/data-types/strings) values of all specified keys.
For every key that doesn't hold a string value or does not exist, the special value `nil` is returned.
Because of this, the operation never fails.

@return

@array-reply: list of values at the specified keys.

@examples

```cli
SET key1 "Hello"
SET key2 "World"
MGET key1 key2 nonexisting
```
