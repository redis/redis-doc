Sets the given keys to their respective values.
`MSETNX` will not perform any operation at all even if just a single key already
exists.

Because of this semantic `MSETNX` can be used in order to set different keys
representing different fields of an unique logic object in a way that ensures
that either all the fields or none at all are set.

`MSETNX` is atomic, so all given keys are set at once.
It is not possible for clients to see that some of the keys were updated while
others are unchanged.

@return

@integer-reply, specifically:

* `1` if the all the keys were set.
* `0` if no key was set (at least one key already existed).

@examples

```cli
MSETNX key1 "Hello" key2 "there"
MSETNX key2 "new" key3 "world"
MGET key1 key2 key3
```
