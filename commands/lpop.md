Removes and returns the first elements of the list stored at `key`.

By default, the command pops a single element from the beginning of the list.
When provided with the optional `count` argument, the reply will consist of up
to `count` elements, depending on the list's length.

@examples

```cli
RPUSH mylist "one" "two" "three" "four" "five"
LPOP mylist
LPOP mylist 2
LRANGE mylist 0 -1
```
