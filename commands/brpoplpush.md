`BRPOPLPUSH` is the blocking variant of `RPOPLPUSH`.
When `source` contains elements, this command behaves exactly like `RPOPLPUSH`.
When used inside a `MULTI`/`EXEC` block, this command behaves exactly like `RPOPLPUSH`.
When `source` is empty, Redis will block the connection until another client
pushes to it or until `timeout` is reached.
A `timeout` of zero can be used to block indefinitely.

As per Redis 6.2.0, BRPOPLPUSH is considered deprecated. Please prefer `BLMOVE` in
new code.

See `RPOPLPUSH` for more information.

@return

@bulk-string-reply: the element being popped from `source` and pushed to `destination`.
If `timeout` is reached, a @nil-reply is returned.

@history

* `>= 6.0`: `timeout` is interpreted as a double instead of an integer.
