Returns the element at index `index` in the list stored at `key`.
The index is zero-based, so `0` means the first element, `1` the second element
and so on.
Negative indices can be used to designate elements starting at the tail of the
list.
Here, `-1` means the last element, `-2` means the penultimate and so forth.

When the value at `key` is not a list, an error is returned.

@examples

```cli
LPUSH mylist "World"
LPUSH mylist "Hello"
LINDEX mylist 0
LINDEX mylist -1
LINDEX mylist 3
```
