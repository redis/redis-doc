Sets the given keys to their respective values.
`MSET` replaces existing values with new values, just as regular `SET`.
See `MSETNX` if you don't want to overwrite existing values.

`MSET` is atomic, so all given keys are set at once.
It is not possible for clients to see that some of the keys were updated while
others are unchanged.

@examples

```cli
MSET key1 "Hello" key2 "World"
GET key1
GET key2
```
