Returns the bit value at _offset_ in the string value stored at _key_.

When _offset_ is beyond the string length, the string is assumed to be a
contiguous space with 0 bits.
When _key_ does not exist it is assumed to be an empty string, so _offset_ is
always out of range and the value is also assumed to be a contiguous space with
0 bits.

@examples

```cli
SETBIT mykey 7 1
GETBIT mykey 0
GETBIT mykey 7
GETBIT mykey 100
```
