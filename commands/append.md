Appends the _value_ to the [Redis string](/docs/data-types/strings) stored at _key_.

If _key_ doesn't exist, it is created and initially set to the empty string (""), so `APPEND` will be similar to `SET` in this special case.

@return

@integer-reply: the length of the string after the append operation.

@examples

```cli
EXISTS mykey
APPEND mykey "Hello"
APPEND mykey " World"
GET mykey
```

## Pattern: Time series

The `APPEND` command can be used to create a very compact representation of a list of fixed-size samples, usually referred to as a _time_ series_.
Every time a new sample arrives we can store it using the command

```
APPEND timeseries "fixed-size sample"
```

Accessing individual elements in the time series isn't hard:

* `STRLEN` can be used to obtain the number of samples.
* `GETRANGE` allows for random access to elements.
  If our time series have associated time information we can easily implement a binary search to get range combining `GETRANGE` with the Lua scripting engine available in Redis 2.6.
* `SETRANGE` can be used to overwrite an existing time series.

The limitation of this pattern is that we are forced into an append-only mode of operation, there is no way to cut the time series to a given size easily because Redis currently lacks a command able to trim string objects.
However the space efficiency of time series stored in this way is remarkable.

Hint: it is possible to switch to a different key based on the current Unix time, in this way, it is possible to have just a relatively small amount of samples per key, to avoid dealing with very big keys, and to make this pattern more friendly to be distributed across many Redis instances.

An example sampling the temperature of a sensor using fixed-size strings (using a binary format is better in real implementations).

```cli
APPEND ts "0043"
APPEND ts "0035"
GETRANGE ts 0 3
GETRANGE ts 4 7
```
