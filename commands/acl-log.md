The command provides a list of recent security events generated by the ACL rules that are in effect.
The events are:

1. Connection authentication failure via either `AUTH` or `HELLO`.
2. Command execution denial because of ACL's command rules.
3. Command execution denial because of ACL's key patterns rules.

The optional argument specifies how many entries to show.
By default, up to ten failures are returned.
The special `RESET` argument clears the log.
Entries are displayed starting from the most recent.

@return

When called to show security events:

@array-reply: an array of @simple-string-reply elements representing ACL security events.

When called with `RESET`:

@simple-string-reply: `OK` if the security log was cleared.

Each log entry is composed of the following fields:

1. `count`: The number of security events detected within a 60 second period that are represented by this entry.
2. `reason`: The reason that the security events were logged. Either `command`, `key`, `channel`, or `auth`.
3. `context`: The context that the security events were detected in. Either `toplevel`, `multi`, `lua`, or `module`.
4. `object`: The resource that the user had insufficient permissions to access. `auth` when the reason is `auth`.
5. `username`: The username that executed the command that caused the security events or the username that had a failed authentication attempt.
6. `age-seconds`: Age of the log entry in seconds.
7. `client-info`: Displays the client info of a client which caused one of the security events.
8. `entry-id`: The sequence number of the entry (starting at 0) since the server process started. Can also be used to check if items were “lost”, if they fell between periods.
9. `timestamp-created`: A UNIX timestamp in `milliseconds` at the time the entry was first created.
10. `timestamp-last-updated`: A UNIX timestamp in `milliseconds` at the time the entry was last updated.
