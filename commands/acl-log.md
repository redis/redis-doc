The command provides a list of recent security events generated by the [Access Control List (ACL)](/docs/management/security/acl#acl-rules) rules that are in effect.
The events are:

1. Connection authentication failure via either `AUTH` or `HELLO`.
2. Command execution denial because of ACL's command rules.
3. Command execution denial because of ACL's key patterns rules.

The optional argument specifies how many entries to show.
By default, up to ten failures are returned.
The special `RESET` argument clears the log.
Entries are displayed starting from the most recent.

@return

When called to show security events:

@array-reply: an array of @bulk-string-reply elements representing ACL security events.

When called with `RESET`:

@simple-string-reply: `OK` if the security log was cleared.

Each log entry is composed of the following fields:

1. **count**: the number of security events detected within a 60-second period.
2. **reason**: the trigger of the security events.
  Can be one of the following:
    1. **command**: no permissions to execute a command.
    2. **key**: no permissions to access a key.
    3. **channel**: no permissions to access a Pub/Sub channel.
    4. **auth**: failed authentication attempt.
3. **context**: the caller's context that generated the events.
  Can be one of the following:
    1. **toplevel**: regular client context.
    2. **multi**: a transaction context.
    3. **lua**: a script or function context.
    4. **module**: a module context.
4. **object**: the resource that the user had insufficient permissions to access, or "auth" when the reason is "auth".
5. **username**: the username that executed the command that caused the security events, or the username that had a failed authentication attempt.
6. **age-seconds**: the entry's age in seconds.
7. **client-info**: information about the client in the same format as `CLIENT INFO`.
8. **entry-id**: the sequence number of the entry (starting at 0) since the server process started.
  Can also be used to check if items were "lost" between one call to the next.
9. **timestamp-created**: the Unix timestamp in milliseconds of the time that the entry was first created.
10. **timestamp-last-updated**: the Unix timestamp in milliseconds of the time that the entry was last updated.
