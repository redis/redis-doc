The `CONFIG SET` command is used in order to reconfigure the server at run time
without the need to restart Redis.
You can change both trivial parameters or switch from one to another persistence
option using this command.

The list of configuration parameters supported by `CONFIG SET` can be obtained
issuing a `CONFIG GET *` command, that is the symmetrical command used to obtain
information about the configuration of a running Redis instance.

All the configuration parameters set using `CONFIG SET` are immediately loaded
by Redis and will take effect starting with the next command executed.

All the supported parameters have the same meaning of the equivalent
configuration parameter used in the [redis.conf][hgcarr22rc] file, with the
following important differences:

[hgcarr22rc]: http://github.com/redis/redis/raw/6.0/redis.conf

* In options where bytes or other quantities are specified, it is not
  possible to use the `redis.conf` abbreviated form (`10k`, `2gb` ... and so forth),
  everything should be specified as a well-formed 64-bit integer, in the base
  unit of the configuration directive. However since Redis version 3.0 or
  greater, it is possible to use `CONFIG SET` with memory units for
  `maxmemory`, client output buffers, and replication backlog size.
* The save parameter is a single string of space-separated integers.
  Every pair of integers represent a seconds/modifications threshold.

For instance what in `redis.conf` looks like:

```
save 900 1
save 300 10
```

that means, save after 900 seconds if there is at least 1 change to the dataset,
and after 300 seconds if there are at least 10 changes to the dataset, should
be set using `CONFIG SET SAVE "900 1 300 10"`.

It is possible to switch persistence from RDB snapshotting to append-only file
(and the other way around) using the `CONFIG SET` command.
For more information about how to do that please check the [persistence
page][tp].

In general what you should know is that setting the `appendonly` parameter to
`yes` will start a background process to save the initial append-only file
(obtained from the in memory data set), and will append all the subsequent
commands on the append-only file, thus obtaining exactly the same effect of a
Redis server that started with AOF turned on since the start.

You can have both the AOF enabled with RDB snapshotting if you want, the two
options are not mutually exclusive.

@simple-string-reply: `OK` when the configuration was set properly.
Otherwise an error is returned.
