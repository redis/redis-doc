Set `key` to hold the string `value` and set `key` to timeout after a given
number of seconds.
This command is equivalent to executing the following commands:

```
SET mykey value
EXPIRE mykey seconds
```

`SETEX` is atomic, and can be reproduced by using the previous two commands
inside an `MULTI` / `EXEC` block.
It is provided as a faster alternative to the given sequence of operations,
because this operation is very common when Redis is used as a cache.

An error is returned when `seconds` is invalid.
