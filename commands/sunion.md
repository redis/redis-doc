Returns the members of the set resulting from the union of all the given sets.

For example:

```
key1 = {a,b,c,d}
key2 = {c}
key3 = {a,c,e}
SUNION key1 key2 key3 = {a,b,c,d,e}
```

Keys that do not exist are considered to be empty sets.

@examples

```cli
SADD key1 "a"
SADD key1 "b"
SADD key1 "c"
SADD key2 "c"
SADD key2 "d"
SADD key2 "e"
SUNION key1 key2
```
