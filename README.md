# Redis documentation

## Clients

All clients are listed under language specific subfolders of [clients](./clients)

The path follows the pattern: ``clients/{language}/github.com/{owner}/{repository}.json``.
The ``{language}`` component of the path is the path-safe representation
of the full language name which is mapped in [languages.json](./languages.json).

Each client's JSON object represents the details displayed on the [clients documentation page](https://redis.io/docs/clients).

For example [clients/python/github.com/redis](./clients/python/github.com/redis/redis-py.json):

```
{
    "name": "redis-py",
    "description": "Mature and supported. Currently the way to go for Python.",
    "recommended": true
}
```

## Commands

Redis commands are described in the `commands.json` file that is auto generated
from the Redis repo based on the JSON files in the commands folder.
See: https://github.com/redis/redis/tree/unstable/src/commands
See: https://github.com/redis/redis/tree/unstable/utils/generate-commands-json.py

For each command there's a Markdown file with a complete, human-readable
description.
We process this Markdown to provide a better experience, so some things to take
into account:

*   Inside text, all commands should be written in all caps, in between
    backticks.
    For example: `INCR`.

*   You can use some magic keywords to name common elements in Redis.
    For example: `@multi-bulk-reply`.
    These keywords will get expanded and auto-linked to relevant parts of the
    documentation.

There should be at least two predefined sections: description and return value.
The return value section is marked using the @return keyword:

```
Returns all keys matching the given pattern.

@return

@multi-bulk-reply: all the keys that matched the pattern.
```

## Styling guidelines

Please use the following formatting rules (aiming for smaller diffs that are easier to review):

* No need for manual lines wrapping at any specific length,
  doing so usually means that adding a word creates a cascade effect and changes other lines.
* Please avoid writing lines that are too long,
  this makes the diff harder to review when only one word is changed. 
* Start every sentence on a new line.


## Checking your work

You should check your changes using Make:

```
$ make
```

This will make sure that JSON and Markdown files compile and that all
text files have no typos.

You need to install a few Ruby gems and [Aspell][aspell] to run these checks.
The gems are listed in the `.gems` file. Install them with the
following command:

```
$ gem install $(sed -e 's/ -v /:/' .gems)
```

The spell checking exceptions should be added to `./wordlist`.
