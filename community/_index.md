## Contributing to Redis

There are many ways to contribute to Redis, starting with documentation all the way to changes to the open source Redis server. Here are a few ways you can get involved.

### Contributing to docs

The [Redis docs](https://github.com/redis/redis-doc) are open source, and we'd love to incorporate your contributions. For small changes and typos, we recommend creating a pull request against [redis-doc repo](https://github.com/redis/redis-doc/pulls).

### Reporting bugs

To report a bug in Redis, create a [Redis Github issue](https://github.com/redis/redis/issues).

For larger doc changes, we ask that you first create an issue describing your proposed changes. This is a good way to get feedback in advance to increase the likelihood that your changes will be accepted.

### Client libraries

The Redis client libraries are nearly always open source and accepting of contributions. Consult the contribution guidelines for the library you're interested in.

### Hacktoberfest

Redis is participating in [Hacktoberfest 2022](/community/hacktoberfest/).
