## redis.io

[Citrusbyte](https://citrusbyte.com) sponsored the creation of the official
Redis logo (designed by [Carlos Prioglio](http://carlosprioglio.com)) and
transferred its copyright to Salvatore Sanfilippo.

They also sponsored the initial implementation of this site by
[Damian Janowski](https://twitter.com/djanowski) and [Michel
Martens](https://twitter.com/soveran). Damian and Michel remain the current
maintainers.

The `redis.io` domain was donated for a few years to the project by [I Want My
Name](https://iwantmyname.com).
