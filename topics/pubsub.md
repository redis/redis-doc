Pub/Sub
=======

`SUBSCRIBE`, `UNSUBSCRIBE` and `PUBLISH`
implement the [Publish/Subscribe messaging
paradigm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish/subscribe) where
(citing Wikipedia) senders (publishers) are not programmed to send
their messages to specific receivers (subscribers). Rather, published
messages are characterized into channels, without knowledge of what (if
any) subscribers there may be. Subscribers express interest in one or
more channels, and only receive messages that are of interest, without
knowledge of what (if any) publishers there are. This decoupling of
publishers and subscribers can allow for greater scalability and a more
dynamic network topology.

For instance in order to subscribe to channels `foo` and `bar` the
client issues a `SUBSCRIBE` providing the names of the channels:

    SUBSCRIBE foo bar

Messages sent by other clients to these channels will be pushed by Redis
to all the subscribed clients.

A client subscribed to one or more channels should not issue commands,
although it can subscribe and unsubscribe to and from other channels.
The replies to subscription and unsubscription operations are sent in
the form of messages, so that the client can just read a coherent
stream of messages where the first element indicates the type of
message. The commands that are allowed in the context of a subscribed
client are `SUBSCRIBE`, `SSUBSCRIBE`, `SUNSUBSCRIBE`, `PSUBSCRIBE`, `UNSUBSCRIBE`, `PUNSUBSCRIBE`, `PING`, `RESET`, and `QUIT`.

Please note that `redis-cli` will not accept any commands once in
subscribed mode and can only quit the mode with `Ctrl-C`.

## Format of pushed messages

A message is a @array-reply with three elements.

The first element is the kind of message:

* `subscribe`: means that we successfully subscribed to the channel
given as the second element in the reply. The third argument represents
the number of channels we are currently subscribed to.

* `unsubscribe`: means that we successfully unsubscribed from the
channel given as second element in the reply. The third argument
represents the number of channels we are currently subscribed to. When
the last argument is zero, we are no longer subscribed to any channel,
and the client can issue any kind of Redis command as we are outside the
Pub/Sub state.

* `message`: it is a message received as result of a `PUBLISH` command
issued by another client. The second element is the name of the
originating channel, and the third argument is the actual message
payload.

## Database & Scoping

Pub/Sub has no relation to the key space.  It was made to not interfere with
it on any level, including database numbers.

Publishing on db 10, will be heard by a subscriber on db 1.

If you need scoping of some kind, prefix the channels with the name of the
environment (test, staging, production, ...).

## Wire protocol example

    SUBSCRIBE first second
    *3
    $9
    subscribe
    $5
    first
    :1
    *3
    $9
    subscribe
    $6
    second
    :2

At this point, from another client we issue a `PUBLISH` operation
against the channel named `second`:

    > PUBLISH second Hello

This is what the first client receives:

    *3
    $7
    message
    $6
    second
    $5
    Hello

Now the client unsubscribes itself from all the channels using the
`UNSUBSCRIBE` command without additional arguments:

    UNSUBSCRIBE
    *3
    $11
    unsubscribe
    $6
    second
    :1
    *3
    $11
    unsubscribe
    $5
    first
    :0

## Pattern-matching subscriptions

The Redis Pub/Sub implementation supports pattern matching. Clients may
subscribe to glob-style patterns in order to receive all the messages
sent to channel names matching a given pattern.

For instance:

    PSUBSCRIBE news.*

Will receive all the messages sent to the channel `news.art.figurative`,
`news.music.jazz`, etc.  All the glob-style patterns are valid, so
multiple wildcards are supported.

    PUNSUBSCRIBE news.*

Will then unsubscribe the client from that pattern.  No other subscriptions
will be affected by this call.

Messages received as a result of pattern matching are sent in a
different format:

* The type of the message is `pmessage`: it is a message received
as result of a `PUBLISH` command issued by another client, matching
a pattern-matching subscription. The second element is the original
pattern matched, the third element is the name of the originating
channel, and the last element the actual message payload.

Similarly to `SUBSCRIBE` and `UNSUBSCRIBE`, `PSUBSCRIBE` and
`PUNSUBSCRIBE` commands are acknowledged by the system sending a message
of type `psubscribe` and `punsubscribe` using the same format as the
`subscribe` and `unsubscribe` message format.

## Messages matching both a pattern and a channel subscription

A client may receive a single message multiple times if it's subscribed
to multiple patterns matching a published message, or if it is
subscribed to both patterns and channels matching the message. Like in
the following example:

    SUBSCRIBE foo
    PSUBSCRIBE f*

In the above example, if a message is sent to channel `foo`, the client
will receive two messages: one of type `message` and one of type
`pmessage`.

## The meaning of the subscription count with pattern matching

In `subscribe`, `unsubscribe`, `psubscribe` and `punsubscribe`
message types, the last argument is the count of subscriptions still
active. This number is actually the total number of channels and
patterns the client is still subscribed to. So the client will exit
the Pub/Sub state only when this count drops to zero as a result of
unsubscribing from all the channels and patterns.

## Sharded pubsub

From 7.0, sharded pubsub is introduced in which shard channels are assigned to slots by the same algorithm used to assign keys to slots. 
A shard message must be sent to a node that own the slot the shard channel is hashed to. 
The cluster makes sure the published shard messages are forwarded to all nodes in the shard, so clients can subscribe to a shard channel by connecting to either the master responsible for the slot, or to any of its replicas.
`SSUBSCRIBE`, `SUNSUBSCRIBE` and `SPUBLISH` are used to implement sharded pubsub.

Sharded pubsub helps to scale the usage of pubsub in cluster mode. 
It restricts the propagation of message to be within the shard of a cluster. 
Hence, the amount of data passing through the cluster bus is limited in comparison to global pubsub where each message propagates to each node in the cluster.
This allows users to horizontally scale the pubsub usage by adding more shards.
 

## Programming example

Pieter Noordhuis provided a great example using EventMachine
and Redis to create [a multi user high performance web
chat](https://gist.github.com/pietern/348262).

## Client library implementation hints

Because all the messages received contain the original subscription
causing the message delivery (the channel in the case of message type,
and the original pattern in the case of pmessage type) client libraries
may bind the original subscription to callbacks (that can be anonymous
functions, blocks, function pointers), using a hash table.

When a message is received an O(1) lookup can be done in order to
deliver the message to the registered callback.
