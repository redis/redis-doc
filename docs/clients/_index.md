Here, you will learn how to connect your application to a Redis database. If you're new to Redis, you might first want to [install Redis with Redis Stack and RedisInsight](/docs/stack/get-started/install).

For more Redis topics, see [Using](/docs/manual/) and [Managing](/docs/management/) Redis.

If you're ready to get started, see the following guides for the official client libraries you can use with Redis. For a complete list of community-driven clients, see [Clients](/resources/clients/).
