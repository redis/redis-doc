    Introduction to the Redis Geospatial data type
---

Redis geospatial indexes let you store coordinates and search for them.
This data structure is useful for finding nearby points within a given radius or bounding box.

## Examples

Suppose you're building a mobile app that lets you find all of the electric car charging stations closest to your current location.

Add several locations to a geospatial index:
```
> GEOADD locations:ca -122.27652 37.805186 station:1
(integer) 1
> GEOADD locations:ca -122.2674626 37.8062344 station:2
(integer) 1
> GEOADD locations:ca -122.2469854 37.8104049 station:3
(integer) 1
```

Find all locations within a 5 kilometer radius of a given location, and return the distance to each location:
```
> GEOSEARCH locations:ca FROMLONLAT -122.2612767 37.7936847 BYRADIUS 5 km WITHDIST
1) 1) "station:1"
   2) "1.8523"
2) 1) "station:2"
   2) "1.4979"
3) 1) "station:3"
   2) "2.2441"
```

## Basic commands

* `GEOADD` adds a location to a given geospatial index (note that longitude comes before latitude with this command).
* `GEOSEARCH` returns locations with a given radius or a bounding box.
