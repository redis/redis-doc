Redis is a data structure server.
At its core, Redis provides a collection of native data types that help you solve a wide variety of problems, from [caching](/docs/manual/client-side-caching/) to [queuing](/docs/data-types/lists/) to [event processing](/docs/data-types/streams/).
Below is a short description of each data type, with links to broader overviews and command references.

If you'd like to try a comprehensive tutorial for each data structure, see their overview pages below.


## Core

### Strings 

[Redis strings](/docs/data-types/strings) are the most basic Redis data type, representing a sequence of bytes.
For more information, see:

* [Overview of Redis strings](/docs/data-types/strings/)
* [Redis string command reference](/commands/?group=string)

### Lists

[Redis lists](/docs/data-types/lists) are lists of strings sorted by insertion order.
For more information, see:

* [Overview of Redis lists](/docs/data-types/lists/)
* [Redis list command reference](/commands/?group=list)

### Sets

[Redis sets](/docs/data-types/sets) are unordered collections of unique strings that act like the sets from your favorite programming language (for example, [Java HashSets](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashSet.html), [Python sets](https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset), and so on).
With a Redis set, you can add, remove, and test for existence in O(1) time (in other words, regardless of the number of set elements).
For more information, see:

* [Overview of Redis sets](/docs/data-types/sets/)
* [Redis set command reference](/commands/?group=set)

### Hashes

[Redis hashes](/docs/data-types/hashes) are record types modeled as collections of field-value pairs.
As such, Redis hashes resemble [Python dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries), [Java HashMaps](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html), and [Ruby hashes](https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.1.2/Hash.html).
For more information, see:

* [Overview of Redis hashes](/docs/data-types/hashes/)
* [Redis hashes command reference](/commands/?group=hash)

### Sorted sets

[Redis sorted sets](/docs/data-types/sorted-sets) are collections of unique strings that maintain order by each string's associated score.
For more information, see:

* [Overview of Redis sorted sets](/docs/data-types/sorted-sets)
* [Redis sorted set command reference](/commands/?group=sorted-set)

### Streams

A [Redis stream](/docs/data-types/streams) is a data structure that acts like an append-only log.
Streams help record events in the order they occur and then syndicate them for processing.
For more information, see:

* [Overview of Redis Streams](/docs/data-types/streams)
* [Redis Streams command reference](/commands/?group=stream)

### Geospatial indexes

[Redis geospatial indexes](/docs/data-types/geospatial) are useful for finding locations within a given geographic radius or bounding box.
For more information, see:

* [Overview of Redis geospatial indexes](/docs/data-types/geospatial/)
* [Redis geospatial indexes command reference](/commands/?group=geo)

### Bitmaps

[Redis bitmaps](/docs/data-types/bitmaps/) let you perform bitwise operations on strings. 
For more information, see:

* [Overview of Redis bitmaps](/docs/data-types/bitmaps/)
* [Redis bitmap command reference](/commands/?group=bitmap)

### Bitfields

[Redis bitfields](/docs/data-types/bitfields/) efficiently encode multiple counters in a string value.
Bitfields provide atomic get, set, and increment operations and support different overflow policies.
For more information, see:

* [Overview of Redis bitfields](/docs/data-types/bitfields/)
* The `BITFIELD` command.

### HyperLogLog

The [Redis HyperLogLog](/docs/data-types/hyperloglogs) data structures provide probabilistic estimates of the cardinality (i.e., number of elements) of large sets. For more information, see:

* [Overview of Redis HyperLogLog](/docs/data-types/hyperloglogs)
* [Redis HyperLogLog command reference](/commands/?group=hyperloglog)

## Extensions

To extend the features provided by the included data types, use one of these options:

1. Write your own custom [server-side functions in Lua](/docs/manual/programmability/).
1. Write your own Redis module using the [modules API](/docs/reference/modules/) or check out the [community-supported modules](/docs/modules/).
1. Use [JSON](/docs/stack/json/), [querying](/docs/stack/search/), [time series](/docs/stack/timeseries/), and other capabilities provided by [Redis Stack](/docs/stack/).
