The Redis command line interface (redis-cli) is a terminal program used to send commands to and read replies from the Redis server. It has two main modes: an interactive Read Eval Print Loop (REPL) mode where the user types Redis commands and receives replies, and a command mode where redis-cli is executed with additional arguments and the reply is printed to the standard output.

RedisInsight combines a graphical user interface with Redis CLI to let you work with any Redis deployment. You can visually browse and interact with data, take advantage of diagnostic tools, learn by example, and much more. Best of all, RedisInsight is free.
