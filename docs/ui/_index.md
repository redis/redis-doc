The Redis command line interface (redis-cli) is a terminal program used to send commands to and read replies from the Redis server. It has two main modes: an interactive Read Eval Print Loop (REPL) mode where the user types Redis commands and receives replies, and a command mode where redis-cli is executed with additional arguments and the reply is printed to the standard output.

RedisInsight is an ideal tool for developers who build with any Redis deployments – including Redis Open Source, Redis Stack, Redis Enterprise Software, Redis Enterprise Cloud, and Amazon ElastiCache – and who want to optimize their development process. RedisInsight lets you visually browse and interact with data, take advantage of the advanced command line interface and diagnostic tools, and so much more. Best of all, RedisInsight is free for everyone.
